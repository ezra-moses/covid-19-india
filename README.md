# covid-19-india

A React app [https://covid-19-india1.herokuapp.com/] using MERN stack (without the M ðŸ˜‰) provides current covid-19 India status. It uses context API and props for state management. A simple express backend route to fetch the data and react frontend to render. The data is refreshed daily once and cached locally so no need of a database as of now.


## Examples
![Alt text](github.gif?raw=true "Covid-19 India")

- On initial page load, the data is fectched and cached locally. 
- Click the states to view the current status
- Click Home button to go back
- Districts within the states won't provide the individual status but rather provides the state's
- gathering districts status I'm not doing it now. Feel free to fork if required.
- Clicking on the Banner will provide overall status
